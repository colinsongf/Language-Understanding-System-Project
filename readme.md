# Language Understanding System Course Project

University of Trento - Federico Marinelli (187419)

The extraction of ﬂat concepts out of a given word sequence is usually one of the ﬁrst steps in building a spoken language understanding (SLU) or dialogue system.

This project aims to evaluate the performance of labelling a word sequence using generative and discriminative algorithms. In particular adopting Stochastic Final State Transducers during the mid-term project, Conditional Random Fields and Recursive Neural Networks during the final project.
